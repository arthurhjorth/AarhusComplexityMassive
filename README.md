## Welcome to Aarhus University Complexity Massive

Are you interested in complexity science? Agent-based modeling? Network dynamics? Then you're in the right place!

[Sign up for our mailing list here!](https://maillist.au.dk/mailman/listinfo/aarhuscomplexitymassive.aias)

AarhusComplexityMassive is an interest group for Complexity Science. We meet every two weeks, to talk about models, discuss papers or our own research, ask for feedback, and to find new and fun ways of collaborating with each other, and colleagues across campus. 

**Our next meeting is on Wednesday December 2nd 2020 15:30-16:30**
* Arthur Hjorth will his paper called [LevelSpace: A NetLogo Extension for Multi-Level Agent-Based Modeling](http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/23/1/4.html) in Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation. For those who can set aside time for 20-25 minutes "homework", you can read parts of the paper. In particular, I'll ask people to focus on sections 8 and 9, dealing with dimensions of multi-levelledness and a typology of ML-ABMs.
* We discuss plans for the future. Iza is proposing we read a book together in January/February, and she'll propose a few different formats for how we could do that. 

Due to Corona, we will meet online, until AIAS allows us back. Our hope is to be able to meet in person as soon as we can. Until then, please use this Zoom-link: https://aarhusuniversity.zoom.us/j/4024649019

Cheers,
[Iza](https://aias.au.dk/aias-fellows/iza-romanowska/) & [Arthur](https://pure.au.dk/portal/da/persons/hermes-arthur-hjorth(b6da5c3f-dc2f-4376-a964-cec167d512e6).html)



-- Old stuff: --

**Tuesday November 17 10:00-11:00**
* Iza Romanowska presents her work in progress on The Origins of Language. (30 minutes)
* Peter Thestrup Waade presents his thoughts on the conceptual and pragmatic overlaps between information theory and complexity science *as far as I understood!*

**Nov 4th 2020**
Our inaugural meeting is on **Wednesday Nov 4th 15:30-16:30**. The second meeting will be on **Tuesday Nov 17th at 10:00-11:00**.

The agenda for the first meeting is relatively open: We wil do introductions, discuss hopes and plans for the group, and set up presentations etc. for the next few meetings.
