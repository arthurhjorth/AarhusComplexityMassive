## Welcome to Aarhus University Complexity Massive

Are you interested in complexity science? Agent-based modeling? Network dynamics? Then you're in the right place1

AUCompass is an interest group for Complexity Science. We meet every so often, to talk about models, discuss papers or our own research, and to find new and fun ways of collaborating with each other, and colleagues across campus. 

Our next meeting is on **Wednesday Nov 4th at 15:30**. 

Due to Corona, we are limited to 10 people in person. This may turn out to be plenty. But to avoid problems, if you are planning on coming, please email [Iza](iromanowska@aias.au.dk) or [Arthur](arthur@mgmt.au.dk).

Cheers,
[Iza](https://aias.au.dk/aias-fellows/iza-romanowska/) & [Arthur](https://pure.au.dk/portal/da/persons/hermes-arthur-hjorth(b6da5c3f-dc2f-4376-a964-cec167d512e6).html)
