## Welcome to Aarhus University Complexity Massive

Are you interested in complexity science? Agent-based modeling? Network dynamics? Then you're in the right place!

[Sign up for our mailing list here!](https://maillist.au.dk/mailman/listinfo/aarhuscomplexitymassive.aias)

AarhusComplexityMassive is an interest group for Complexity Science. We meet every two weeks, to talk about models, discuss papers or our own research, ask for feedback, and to find new and fun ways of collaborating with each other, and colleagues across campus. 

**Our next meeting is on Weds Feb 18th 2021 15:30-16:30**

Ida Bang Hansen presents "Educational Agent-Based Models" 


**Scheduled Future Presentations: (dates are set, but the order of presentations might change)**

* Feb 17th: Ida Bang-Hansen presents NetLogo-based complex systems thinking educational activities from middle school to the university level
* Mar 2nd: Peter Thestrup Waade presents his PhD dissertation project proposal
* Mar 17th: Christoffer Lundbak Olesen presents his master's dissertation proposal on combining information theory and complexity science.


**Unscheduled presentations:**
* Anna Agermose Hinrichsen: Master's dissertation on modeling human emotional responses to COVID19-isolation, and its impact on education completion.



Due to Corona, we will meet online, until AIAS allows us back. Our hope is to be able to meet in person as soon as we can. Until then, please use this Zoom-link: https://aarhusuniversity.zoom.us/j/4024649019

Cheers,
[Iza](https://aias.au.dk/aias-fellows/iza-romanowska/) & [Arthur](https://pure.au.dk/portal/da/persons/hermes-arthur-hjorth(b6da5c3f-dc2f-4376-a964-cec167d512e6).html)



-- Old stuff: --

**Tuesday Feb 2nd 2021 10:00-11**

Arthur Hjorth presents "Complex Systems Thinking in Education". Complex Systems and Agent-Based Modeling are increasingly used in education. In this talk, I present 
 * what is Complex Systems Thinking?
 * what does it mean to get better at it? (i.e. what is "learning" in the context of complex systems thinking?)
 * how do we design good Complex Systems Thinking learning activities?
 * how do we document it empirically? What are good methods for ?


**  Wednesday January 20th: **
Iza Romanowska will facilitate a discussion on the first 4 chapters of The Model Thinker. _Participants are expected to find a copy of the book and read the first four chapters. If you are unable to find it, get in touch and we will see if we can help._
* Guiding questions for reading:

    What assumptions is the author making about human nature, and about human social processes?
    Does the author's background as economist shine through in their description of humans?
    Do you contest any of these assumptions? How, why?


** December 2nd 2020 ** 
* Arthur Hjorth will his paper called [LevelSpace: A NetLogo Extension for Multi-Level Agent-Based Modeling](http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/23/1/4.html) in Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation. For those who can set aside time for 20-25 minutes "homework", you can read parts of the paper. In particular, I'll ask people to focus on sections 8 and 9, dealing with dimensions of multi-levelledness and a typology of ML-ABMs.
* We discuss plans for the future. Iza is proposing we read a book together in January/February, and she'll propose a few different formats for how we could do that. 


**Tuesday November 17 10:00-11:00**
* Iza Romanowska presents her work in progress on The Origins of Language. (30 minutes)
* Peter Thestrup Waade presents his thoughts on the conceptual and pragmatic overlaps between information theory and complexity science *as far as I understood!*

**Nov 4th 2020**
Our inaugural meeting is on **Wednesday Nov 4th 15:30-16:30**. The second meeting will be on **Tuesday Nov 17th at 10:00-11:00**.

The agenda for the first meeting is relatively open: We wil do introductions, discuss hopes and plans for the group, and set up presentations etc. for the next few meetings.
